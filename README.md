- Technologies such as Javascript, NodeJS, NoSQL DataBases (MongoDB), Bootswatch (Alternative of Bootstrap), likewise, these technologies were chosen to work on programming logic in a university course of NoSQL databases.


## Technologies Used

- MongoDB - version 6.0.1
- Bootswatch 


## Features

## Setup
The development environment is shaped by: 
- Visual Studio Code



## Usage
Clone the repository in your local environment or fork the repository too, just open it in an IDE/Editor and download the dependencies. 


## Project Status
Project is: Progress, the app is finished but some changes can be aplied to improve several functionalities.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Implement forgot password functionality which is essential in a Web App these days.
- Set roles for the users and apply authorization for them. 
- Validate account creation with an email with the purpose of decrease boots, inactive users etc.
- Establish better relationships for collections (MongoDB).

To do:
- Nothing for the correct functionality of the app, but as I said maybe some changes to improve the app for being more realistic or productivity as a real tool.
